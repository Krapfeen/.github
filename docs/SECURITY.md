# Security Policy

I take the security of my projects seriously and appreciate your help in keeping them secure. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it to me by following the instructions below.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability in one of my projects, please **do not create a public issue** on GitHub. Instead, contact me directly so I can address the issue before it is publicly disclosed.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1. Email me at: [theAndrewSchaefer@gmail.com](mailto:theAndrewSchaefer@gmail.com).
2. Include the following information in your email:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The version of the project (if applicable).
   - Any additional details that may help in resolving the vulnerability.

I will try to respond to your report within **48 hours** and provide updates as I work on fixing the issue.

## My Policy

- I will review all vulnerability reports and aim to fix them as soon as possible.
- I will not pursue or take action against anyone who responsibly reports vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy.
- I will acknowledge your help in resolving the vulnerability if you wish.

## Acknowledgments

I value the community's contribution to improving the security of my projects. If you help me identify and fix a vulnerability, I will be happy to credit you in the acknowledgments section (if you wish).
